# 🚀 Java Projects Repository  

Welcome to my **Java Projects Repository**! 🎯  

I started learning **Java in 2024** as part of my **Higher Diploma in Science in Computing** at **National College of Ireland**. As I progress in my journey, I believe in the **power of small, consistent improvements**—**1% better every day**. Inspired by the concept of **atomic habits**, I am building small software projects to strengthen my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and overall software development mindset.  

This repository is a **living collection** of projects, ranging from simple Java exercises to more complex applications. Each project represents a step in my growth as a developer, showcasing my hands-on learning experience.  

### 🔥 What You'll Find Here:
✅ Java programs covering **OOP, data structures, algorithms, and more**  
✅ **Small but impactful** software projects  
✅ **Practical coding exercises** to reinforce learning  
✅ Continuous improvements as I apply new concepts  

📌 Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or even collaborate! 🚀
